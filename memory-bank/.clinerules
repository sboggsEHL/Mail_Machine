# Cline Rules

## Critical Implementation Paths
- The database implementation must follow the step-by-step guide in `Seans-dumbdumb-db-guide.md`
- Loan ID generation follows the format `[LoanType][State][YY][Week]-[Sequence]` and is critical for tracking
- The `complete_property_view` is the primary interface for loan officers to access all property and loan data
- DNM (Do Not Mail) enforcement must be automatic through database triggers

## User Preferences and Workflow
- Documentation should be clear and accessible, with step-by-step instructions
- SQL scripts should include comments explaining their purpose and expected outcomes
- Database design prioritizes quick lookups by loan officers when recipients call
- Backward compatibility with existing systems is important, particularly the `mailready` table

## Project-Specific Patterns
- PropertyRadar is the source of truth for property data
- Loan IDs are generated automatically through database triggers
- History tracking is implemented for all important tables
- System configuration is stored in the database rather than hardcoded
- Materialized views are used for reporting and must be refreshed regularly

## Known Challenges
- History tables will grow over time and require archival strategies
- Loan ID collision handling needs to be robust
- DNM enforcement must be reliable to ensure compliance
- Performance optimization is critical for large data volumes
- Backward compatibility adds complexity to the design

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The system has evolved from manual processes to an automated workflow
- Database-centric design was chosen for its reliability and transaction support
- Trigger-based automation was selected to ensure consistency
- The loan ID format was designed to be both human-readable and machine-processable

## Tool Usage Patterns
- PostgreSQL is the primary database system
- SQL scripts are used for database setup and maintenance
- Cron jobs or scheduled tasks are required for regular maintenance
- PropertyRadar API is used for data sourcing
- CSV files are used for data exchange with mailing services
