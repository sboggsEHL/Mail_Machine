# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing batch job processing system for large data volumes
- Building property payload handling and processing capabilities
- Connecting batch jobs with PropertyRadar API integration
- Implementing job queue for asynchronous processing
- Implementing worker processes for background job execution
- Creating UI components for batch job management and monitoring
- Building property file processing functionality
- Enhancing the normalized database structure to support multiple lead providers
- Establishing the loan ID generation system
- Creating views for loan officer interfaces

## Recent Changes
- Implemented batch job system with:
  - BatchJob model with status tracking and progress monitoring
  - BatchJobRepository for database operations
  - BatchJobService for business logic
  - BatchJobController for API endpoints
  - JobQueueService for asynchronous processing
  - Worker implementation for background processing
- Added batch file status tracking for property file processing
- Implemented property payload service for raw property data handling
- Added UI components for batch job management:
  - BatchJobList for viewing all jobs
  - BatchJobDetails for viewing job details
  - BatchJobManager for overall job management
- Implemented PropertyFileProcessor component for handling property files
- Implemented property batch service for processing property data in batches
- Created dedicated worker processes with proper TypeScript configuration
- Enhanced PropertyRadar criteria builder interface:
  - Added specialized UI components for different criteria types
  - Fixed state management issues 
  - Added JSON preview to show criteria before submission
  - Added visual feedback for selected criteria (colored badges)
  - Fixed issue with criteria selection in the same tab (now multiple criteria can be selected within the same category without interfering with each other)
  - Added Address search capability in the Property tab for searching by specific street addresses
- Implemented JWT-based authentication:
  - Created auth service for token management
  - Added token refresh functionality
  - Protected routes with auth middleware
  - Updated UI to handle authenticated state
- Enhanced the database implementation:
  - Added support for multiple lead providers
  - Created property_owners table for multiple owners per property
  - Updated loan-related tables and relationships
  - Enhanced triggers and functions

## Next Steps
- Complete end-to-end testing of batch job processing
- Implement error handling and retry logic for failed jobs
- Add job prioritization capabilities
- Enhance monitoring and reporting for batch jobs
- Implement job cancellation functionality
- Optimize worker processes for performance
- Add more comprehensive error handling for PropertyRadar API responses
- Integrate batch processing with mail campaign generation
- Implement additional reporting views for campaign managers
- Complete the authentication implementation with role-based access control
- Set up scheduled tasks for maintenance operations
- Establish comprehensive testing procedures
- Implement security measures and access controls

## Active Decisions
- Using database-based job queue management
- Implementing dedicated worker processes vs. in-process job execution
- Batch size determination for optimal processing performance
- Error handling and retry strategies for failed jobs
- Job prioritization algorithm and queue management
- File storage strategy for property payloads
- Database partitioning strategy for large datasets
- Monitoring and alerting approach for job failures
- Data archival strategy for historical job data
- Security implementation for sensitive property and loan data
- API authentication and authorization strategy
- UI/UX design for batch job monitoring and management
- Implementation of comprehensive logging for debugging and auditing
- Backup and recovery procedures for data protection

# Application Codebase Review (April 2025)

## Backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
- Modular, function-based design with clear separation:
  - `server.ts` starts the API server and handles shutdown.
  - `app.ts` initializes the Express app.
  - `worker.ts` runs background workers for batch jobs.
  - `property-processor.ts` handles batch property processing.
- Likely uses repositories and services for data access and business logic.
- Integrates with PostgreSQL for data storage and job queue.
- Implements JWT-based authentication.
- Async/await used throughout for non-blocking operations.
- Batch processing is decoupled from API server, improving scalability.
- TypeScript enforces type safety.

## Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- Root component: `App.tsx`.
- Key components:
  - `ApiParamsForm` for PropertyRadar criteria building.
  - `FieldSelector` for selecting fields.
  - `InsertResults` for displaying API/data results.
  - `Login` for authentication.
  - `PropertyList` for displaying property data.
- Likely uses hooks for state management.
- Integrates with backend API.
- Modular, reusable components with strong typing.

## Shared Types
- Located in `shared/types/`.
- Define interfaces for auth, criteria, database models, API contracts.
- Promote strong typing across backend and frontend.

## Scripts
- Located in `property-data-tester/scripts/`.
- Utilities for batch processing, data import/export, validation, maintenance.
- Support main workflows but not core app logic.

## Overall Observations
- Clean separation of backend API, background processing, and frontend UI.
- Batch processing well-isolated.
- Extensive use of TypeScript improves reliability.
- Modular design supports extensibility.
- Aligns well with documented architecture and goals.
- Potential future review areas: service/repository implementations, error handling, security, database queries, React state management.
