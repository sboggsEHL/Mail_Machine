# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing JWT-based authentication for the PropertyRadar API tester application
- Implementing the normalized database structure to support multiple lead providers
- Setting up the core tables, relationships, and automated workflows
- Establishing the loan ID generation system
- Creating views for loan officer interfaces

## Recent Changes
- Converted from session-based authentication to JWT (JSON Web Token) based auth
- Created a dedicated auth service for token management and automatic refresh
- Fixed route mapping for authentication endpoints (/api/auth/login)
- Updated the main App component to handle authenticated vs. unauthenticated state
- Stored tokens in localStorage rather than cookies for stateless authentication
- Connected the system to the existing PostgreSQL database "mailhaus" with its users table
- Updated database implementation guide to match the normalized field mapping
- Split the guide into two files for better organization
- Added lead_providers table to support multiple data sources
- Created a separate property_owners table to handle multiple owners per property
- Enhanced the loans table with additional fields like loan_position and rate_type
- Updated all related triggers, functions, and views to work with the normalized structure
- Added comprehensive field mapping table showing how PropertyRadar fields map to database fields
- Documented practical examples of how to use the database

## Next Steps
- Fix credential verification in UserRepository to ensure working login functionality
- Debug bcrypt password comparison for the existing users in the database
- Complete the authentication implementation with route protection
- Implement the database schema following the updated guide
- Set up scheduled tasks for materialized view refreshes and data archival
- Create any necessary API endpoints or interfaces for loan officer access
- Develop data import processes for PropertyRadar data
- Establish testing procedures for the complete workflow
- Implement security measures and access controls

## Active Decisions
- Choosing JWT over session-based authentication for better scalability and stateless operation
- Storing tokens in localStorage rather than cookies for easier client-side management
- Determining the optimal archival strategy for historical data
- Considering performance optimizations for large data volumes
- Evaluating security measures for protecting sensitive property and owner information
- Deciding on monitoring and alerting systems for database health
- Planning for disaster recovery and backup procedures
- Evaluating how to handle multiple lead providers in the future
