# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing batch job processing system for large data volumes
- Building property payload handling and processing capabilities
- Connecting batch jobs with PropertyRadar API integration
- Implementing job queue for asynchronous processing
- Implementing worker processes for background job execution
- Creating UI components for batch job management and monitoring
- Building property file processing functionality
- Enhancing the normalized database structure to support multiple lead providers
- Establishing the loan ID generation system
- Creating views for loan officer interfaces

## Recent Changes
- Implemented batch job system with:
  - BatchJob model with status tracking and progress monitoring
  - BatchJobRepository for database operations
  - BatchJobService for business logic
  - BatchJobController for API endpoints
  - JobQueueService for asynchronous processing
  - Worker implementation for background processing
- Added batch file status tracking for property file processing
- Implemented property payload service for raw property data handling
- Added UI components for batch job management:
  - BatchJobList for viewing all jobs
  - BatchJobDetails for viewing job details
  - BatchJobManager for overall job management
- Implemented PropertyFileProcessor component for handling property files
- Implemented property batch service for processing property data in batches
- Created dedicated worker processes with proper TypeScript configuration
- Enhanced PropertyRadar criteria builder interface:
  - Added specialized UI components for different criteria types
  - Fixed state management issues 
  - Added JSON preview to show criteria before submission
  - Added visual feedback for selected criteria (colored badges)
  - Fixed issue with criteria selection in the same tab (now multiple criteria can be selected within the same category without interfering with each other)
  - Added Address search capability in the Property tab for searching by specific street addresses
- Implemented JWT-based authentication:
  - Created auth service for token management
  - Added token refresh functionality
  - Protected routes with auth middleware
  - Updated UI to handle authenticated state
- Enhanced the database implementation:
  - Added support for multiple lead providers
  - Created property_owners table for multiple owners per property
  - Updated loan-related tables and relationships
  - Enhanced triggers and functions

## Next Steps
- Complete end-to-end testing of batch job processing
- Implement error handling and retry logic for failed jobs
- Add job prioritization capabilities
- Enhance monitoring and reporting for batch jobs
- Implement job cancellation functionality
- Optimize worker processes for performance
- Add more comprehensive error handling for PropertyRadar API responses
- Integrate batch processing with mail campaign generation
- Implement additional reporting views for campaign managers
- Complete the authentication implementation with role-based access control
- Set up scheduled tasks for maintenance operations
- Establish comprehensive testing procedures
- Implement security measures and access controls
