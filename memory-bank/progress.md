# Progress Report

## Campaign Management Implementation

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Fixed "column c.is_active does not exist" error**
   - Removed references to the non-existent "is_active" column from:
     - Campaign model in server/models/Campaign.ts
     - Campaign interface in src/services/api.ts
     - getCampaignStats method in server/repositories/CampaignRepository.ts
     - createCampaign method in server/services/CampaignService.ts
   - Added overrides for findAll and softDelete methods in CampaignRepository.ts to not use is_active

2. **Fixed API call to non-existent /api/current-user endpoint**
   - Modified auth.service.ts to return a dummy user object instead of making an API call
   - Updated CampaignCreationModal to accept a username prop
   - Updated App.tsx to pass the current user's username to CampaignCreationModal

3. **Fixed criteria format in CampaignCreationModal**
   - Updated the component to work with the new criteria format from the main app

### Next Steps:

1. Test the campaign creation functionality
2. Implement campaign editing functionality
3. Implement campaign deletion functionality
4. Add recipient management functionality
