2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add monitoring and reporting for property processing
4. Enhance performance for large datasets

## Campaign Management Implementation

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Fixed "column c.is_active does not exist" error**
   - Removed references to the non-existent "is_active" column from:
     - Campaign model in server/models/Campaign.ts
     - Campaign interface in src/services/api.ts
     - getCampaignStats method in server/repositories/CampaignRepository.ts
     - createCampaign method in server/services/CampaignService.ts
   - Added overrides for findAll and softDelete methods in CampaignRepository.ts to not use is_active

2. **Fixed API call to non-existent /api/current-user endpoint**
   - Modified auth.service.ts to return a dummy user object instead of making an API call
   - Updated CampaignCreationModal to accept a username prop
   - Updated App.tsx to pass the current user's username to CampaignCreationModal

3. **Fixed criteria format in CampaignCreationModal**
   - Updated the component to work with the new criteria format from the main app

### Next Steps:

1. Test the campaign creation functionality
2. Implement campaign editing functionality
3. Implement campaign deletion functionality
4. Add recipient management functionality

## PropertyRadar API Integration

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Fixed PropertyRadar API request format**
   - Updated PropertyRadarCriteriaMapper.ts to:
     - Convert boolean values to strings ("1" and "0") instead of numbers
     - Format date fields correctly (MM/DD/YYYY format)
     - Map LastTransferRecDate to FirstDate
   - Updated PropertyController.ts to handle boolean values correctly
   - Added FirstDate field to criteriaDefinitions.ts

2. **Fixed database issues**
   - Updated LoanRepository.ts to use the correct sequence name "loan_id_sequence_sequence_id_seq"
   - Created SQL for the missing batch_job_logs table

3. **Updated documentation**
   - Added detailed information about PropertyRadar API requirements to PropertyRadarAPI.md
   - Documented common pitfalls and their solutions

4. **Fixed UI issues**
   - Fixed issue in ApiParamsForm.tsx where selecting a criterion (like Property Type) prevented selecting other criteria in the same tab
   - Modified the useEffect hook to respect user selections within the same category
   - Improved the logic for determining when to set the default selected criterion without overriding user choices

5. **Added Address search capability**
   - Added Address criterion to criteriaDefinitions.ts in the property section
   - Added human-readable explanation for Address criterion in ApiParamsForm.tsx
   - Ensured proper formatting for the PropertyRadar API

### Next Steps:

1. Implement batch processing for large property datasets
2. Add more comprehensive error handling for API responses
3. Create a UI for viewing and managing batch jobs
