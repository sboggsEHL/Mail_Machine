# Progress

## What Works
- Documentation of the system requirements and architecture is complete
- PropertyRadar field mapping to database fields has been defined with a normalized structure
- Database implementation guide with SQL scripts has been updated to match normalized structure
- Loan ID format and generation logic has been designed
- Core workflow and data relationships have been documented
- Field mapping from PropertyRadar to the normalized database structure is complete
- JWT-based authentication system infrastructure is implemented:
  - JWT token generation and verification utilities
  - Auth routes and controllers
  - Client-side token management via auth.service.ts
  - Token-based API protection through middleware
  - UI components for login/logout flow

## What's Left to Build
- Fix credential verification in UserRepository for successful login
- Debug bcrypt password handling for mailhaus users table
- Complete protected route implementation
- Create API endpoints for property data testing
- Actual database implementation following the updated guide
- Data import processes from PropertyRadar
- User interfaces for loan officers to access the complete_property_view
- Scheduled tasks for maintenance operations
- Testing of the complete workflow
- Security measures and access controls
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Current Status
- Planning phase is complete
- Implementation phase is in progress
- Authentication system is partially implemented (infra exists but login not working)
- JWT-based auth replaces earlier session-based auth for better scalability
- Documentation is comprehensive and aligned between field mapping and database guide
- Normalized database structure has been designed to support multiple lead providers
- Database implementation guide has been split into two files for better organization
- PropertyRadar API tester application has login UI and token management

## Known Issues
- Login credentials verification not working - "Invalid credentials" error
- JWT-based auth setup requires debug of bcrypt comparison for mailhaus users
- No actual property database implementation has been started yet
- The system will require regular maintenance for materialized view refreshes
- Large history tables may impact performance over time without proper archival
- Backward compatibility with the mailready table may introduce complexity
- The loan ID collision handling may need refinement based on real-world usage patterns
