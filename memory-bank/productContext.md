# Product Context

## Purpose
- This project exists to streamline and automate the process of identifying potential refinance opportunities and managing direct mail campaigns to property owners.
- It provides value by creating an efficient workflow from property data collection to lead generation and response handling.
- The system enables loan officers to quickly access property and loan information when recipients respond to mailings.

## Problems Solved
- Manual property data management is time-consuming and error-prone; this system automates data standardization and processing.
- Tracking which properties have been mailed to and preventing duplicate mailings is challenging without a centralized system.
- Without unique identifiers, connecting mail recipients to their property data when they call is difficult and inefficient.
- Compliance with Do Not Mail requests requires careful tracking and enforcement, which this system automates.
- Generating consistent mail campaign data with accurate dates and contact information is complex without automation.

## User Experience Goals
- Loan officers should be able to instantly look up property and loan information when a recipient calls, using only the loan ID from the mailer.
- The system should prevent mailing to properties in the Do Not Mail registry automatically.
- Campaign managers should have clear visibility into campaign status, including counts of pending, mailed, returned, and responded mailings.
- Data entry and campaign setup should be streamlined with automated date calculations and standardized formats.
- The system should maintain a complete history of property and loan changes for audit and compliance purposes.
