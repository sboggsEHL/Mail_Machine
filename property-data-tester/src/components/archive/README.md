# Archived Components

This directory contains components that are no longer actively used in the application but are preserved for reference or potential future use.

## Components

### PropertyRadarCriteriaDemo

A demo component for testing PropertyRadar criteria selection and search functionality.

### TestPage

A simple test page for testing individual components.

## Usage

These components are still imported and available in the application code, but they have been removed from the navigation menu to declutter the UI.

If you need to access these components for testing or reference, you can still navigate to them directly by setting the `currentPage` state in App.tsx to 'criteria-demo' or 'test-page', or by manually navigating to the URLs:

- `/#criteria-demo`
- `/#test-page`
